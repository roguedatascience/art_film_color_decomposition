This project grew out of a basic question: what are the colors that Fernando Botero, a famous Colombian painter and scultpter, uses in "Los Musicos"?

</p>

This lead to a natural next question: how do these colors compare to his other paintings?

</p>

Then of course: how does Botero compare to other painters?

To answer these questions, I developped an algorithm that extraxts and consistently graphs the the main colors from a group of images. These images can be, for example, the life work of an painter, like Botero. They can also be the trailer of movie or the opeikng credits of a TV show (for these, the videos were sampled for still images).

Here are some examples:

#### Fernando Botero

The full code for the color decomposition of Botero's work can be found here: [Boter example](botero_example).
